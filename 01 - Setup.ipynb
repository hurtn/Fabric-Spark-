{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Batch or continuous ingestion of incremental data using Spark Structure Streaming\n","\n","Scenario: You wish to maintain a \"copy\" of source system tables in your lakehouse. An incremental feed of changes is published as files (parquet) to OneLake. You need to merge these changes (inserts, updates & deletes) to target tables as an incremental operation i.e. only process new changes/files which have arrived. The process needs to keep the target tables in sync either in near real-time or frequently (hourly, daily) to support downstream ETL pipelines.  \n","\n","Session outcomes: Demonstrate how to merge incremental data feeds from OneLake into target Lakehouse tables using Spark Structured Streaming.\n","\n","![Overview](https://github.com/hurtn/Fabric-Spark-/blob/main/Overview.png?raw=true)\n","\n","What is Spark Structured Streaming: Structured Streaming is a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the Spark SQL engine. You can express your streaming computation the same way you would express a batch computation on static data. The Spark SQL engine will take care of running it incrementally and continuously and updating the final result as streaming/incremental data continues to arrive. For more information on strucuted streaming please refer to the [Apache Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html).\n","The engine uses a mechanism called checkpointing to keep track of which files have already been processed. This means that even in the event of failure, Structured Streaming can unsure end-to-end exactly-once semantics whereby each file will be processed only once. The main notebook can also be run in both batch (scheduled) or continuous (micro-batch) mode based on the [streaming trigger](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#triggers) configuration and will utilise checkpoints to only process new data.\n","\n","To get started: Ensure you have imported the following three notebooks (including this one) into your workspace. A summary of the notebooks is as follows:\n","\n","01 - Setup: This notebook will guide you through the setup by creating Lakehouse tables based on WWI sample data as part of the [lakehouse tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/tutorial-lakehouse-data-ingestion). It will also allow you to simulate the arrival of new incremental data and verify that data has been merged into the target tables.\n","\n","02 - Orchestrator: The notebook orchestrates the ingestion process. A definition of tables and related metadata is dynamically generated (DAG) which is submitted as a set of instructions to the [runMulitple Spark utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/microsoft-spark-utilities#reference-run-multiple-notebooks-in-parallel). The DAG runs the referenced notebook (03 - TableLoader) for each table, detecting new data to merge into the Lakehouse table. \n","\n","03 - TableLoader: An instance of this notebook runs for each table (concurrently) merging new incremental data/files with the associated target Lakehouse table. Depending on the trigger configuration, it will run either once for all tables per schedule before handing back control to the Orchestrator notebook, or it will run continuously until terminated or an error occurs.\n","\n"," <font size=\"2\" color=\"red\" face=\"sans-serif\" bold> \n","\n","<b> <i> <u>Open each notebook and make sure that for every Notebook a default lakehouse has been pinned\n","</font>\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"44e34426-4dec-4f81-b1ae-834ecbfb84eb"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### Step 1 - Initialise\n","Set the desired number of tables to run this demonstration against.
